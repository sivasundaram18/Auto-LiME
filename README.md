Automated bash script for Linux kernel profile creation.


Followed by my blog writing about how to create linux profile for volatility (https://medium.com/@sivasundaram18/live-memory-acquisition-for-linux-flavors-dfir-65fde6175c6c), i thought of automating the same process instead of manually executing list of commands and waiting for it to complete.

Easy to use,  run the script with sudo permission and respective kernel profile will be created under volatility linux profile.
